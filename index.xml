      <title>Encrypted Volumes</title>

      <description>When I started self hosting services I was afraid of storing my non-sensitive data encrypted. As I played with different kinds of hardware setups, hypervisors and hosting strategies I have made a decision to not encrypt the volumes attatched to my docker containers. This was so that when I inevitably break stuff, I can easily still access everything and move it to a new home where it can be used again.</description>

      <title>Backup and Restore</title>

      <description>So, you have a backup. Wait, two backups? And a third one off site too?? But&amp;hellip; You have tested the restore procedure, right? No!? Damn son, what do you need a backup for if you don&amp;rsquo;t even know if you can restore it???
If you can&amp;rsquo;t restore it, you don&amp;rsquo;t really have a backup&amp;hellip; Protecting your data doesn&amp;rsquo;t end at having a 3-2-1 backup. Whether you are self hosting services or handle company data in the cloud it pays to have a practiced plan for bringing your services and data back to life.</description>

      <title>HA in the homelab</title>

      <description>In general I like things simple. I need technology to work for me and provide value without having to dedicate extraordinary amount of time to it. When it comes to running a homelab this is especially true, since I am likely spending my own free time setting things up and maintaining my infrastrcuture. At a certain point in the life of my homelab however I found myself hosting services for my wife, family and some friends.</description>

      <title>Wireguard &#43; Linode &#43; Unraid = Profit</title>

      <description>I have been using Unraid as a platform to manage my storage at home as well as hosting a few basic services for me and my family for a good few years now. Despite having a fairly fast internet connection I was not able to expose those services to the internet however as my home router does not support dynamic DNS. As an alternative I knew that I could get a small VM with a public IP address which could host a VPN endpoint for me to build a permanent tunnel to my Unraid box.</description>
