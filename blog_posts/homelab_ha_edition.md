# HA in the homelab

In general I like things simple. I need technology to work for me and provide value without having to dedicate extraordinary amount of time to it. When it comes to running a homelab this is especially true, since I am likely spending my own free time setting things up and maintaining my infrastrcuture. At a certain point in the life of my homelab however I found myself hosting services for my wife, family and some friends. This meant that I started to worry about a new challenge, which was the ability to keep my services up so that the people taking advantage of my services can do so without unpleasant disruptions.

## The Beginning
In the beginning I hosted everything on my lone Unraid server, which I built by converting an old desktop machine I had laying around, a very common beginning for a homelab. Unraid gives you a very economical way to manage mass storage with some redundancy, with the ability to run docker containers and mount their volumes to either the spinning rust array, or an ssd cache drive.
