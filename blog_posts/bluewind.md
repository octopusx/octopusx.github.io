In a recent surprising turn of events I got to connect with some listeners of Jupiter Broadcasting shows, one of which happens to be involved in organising the Berlin Hack and Tell meetup, which is a cool monthly event where people do short demos of cool projects they had hacked together. After some chatting with this funky group of tech enthusiasts I was encouraged to present some of my project that seem to be a perfect fit for Berlin Hack and Tell, so ahead of submitting my lightning talk I wanted to make a blog post here first to put down in words how this project came to be and what it actually is, in case anyone fancies finding out more about it.

## Give yourself no excuse

When it comes to building positive habits, including trying to exercise regularly, I find it important to lower the barrier to entry for myself. One of the ways that I have achieved this is having an indoor cycling setup with a bike on a turbo in front of a TV screen. The bike is always ready, the turbo can be turned on remotely from my phone and controlled by a sports app that suggests me the optimal workout for each day. I try to always have fresh cycling clothes ready. No need for my brain to perform mental gymnastics and participation in a self indulgent competition of making up excuses related to all those minor inconveniances, seemingly rendering me incapable of just jumping on a bike and sweating out some of my frustrations and calories that I could really do with getting rid of.

As a techie the gadgetry side of sport science is very appealing to me and naturally I have eventually paired my turbo trainer with an expensive bluetooth fan which promissed seamless integration into my indoor cycling ecosystem of gadgets. Alas, it was not meant to be. The fan is able to simulate wind speed of up to 25km/h. However the indoor trainer does not simulate correct speed in ERG mode, and that is the mode I predominantly use for my training (using TrainerRoad). The fan can also track your heard rate, but for whatever reason it would never reach the full speed no matter how high my HR had gotten during the workouts I had tried this feature on. This has left me stuck with the manual speed mode, where I must adjust the speed myself between the 4 predefined speed presets. That would not be a big issue had it not been for the fact that in order to use this option I have to either:
- Jump off the bike in order to reach the buttons of this, so called, "smart" fan
- Switch apps on my phone multiple times mid ride from TrainerRoad to the Wahoo app and back in order to adjust

This was not ideal and definitely did not match my usual "low barier to entry" vission for how I like to enjoy my indoor sweating time. And don't get me wrong, this fan is fantastic (pun intended) and does a great job in the core area of its functionality - being a fan and cooling me down, but I decided to take the matter in my own hands and take it up a notch from good to great!
